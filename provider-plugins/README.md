# Provider Plugins
These are the manifest files and/or scripts needed to utilize backend providers


## Plugin Manifest
Each plugin provides a single JSON manifest file with all the necessary information about the plugin itself (name, version, etc). The plugin script should also be included in the same directory as the manifest.

### Manifest Format
*See the `sample-manifest.json` file for a complete example*
